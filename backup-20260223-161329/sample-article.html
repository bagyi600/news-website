        <p><strong>That $5 latte is about to become $7. But inflation isn't the only culprit. A perfect storm of climate change, supply chain breakdowns, and changing global demand is brewing—and your morning ritual is ground zero.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="key-facts">
        <h3>📊 Key Facts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Coffee prices up 47% year-over-year, the largest increase in decades</li>
            <li>Brazil's coffee crop damaged by unprecedented frosts</li>
            <li>Shipping costs from Vietnam up 300% due to Red Sea disruptions</li>
            <li>Global coffee demand growing 2.5% annually while supply shrinks</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>The Surface Story</h2>
    <p>Walk into any coffee shop this week and you'll see new price signs. Starbucks raised prices 8% nationwide. Your local roaster? Probably 10-15%. The media is calling it "inflation's latest victim." But that's only part of the story.</p>

    <h2>Why This Is Happening</h2>
    
    <div class="analysis-section">
        <h3>🔍 Deep Analysis: The Three-Storm Convergence</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Climate Change Hits Coffee Belt</h4>
        <p>Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, just experienced its worst frost in 50 years. But this wasn't bad luck—it's climate pattern shift. The coffee belt is warming, creating conditions for extreme weather events. Farmers who could once predict harvests now face complete crop losses.</p>
        
        <h4>2. Supply Chain Domino Effect</h4>
        <p>The Red Sea shipping crisis isn't just about oil. Vietnam's robusta beans (used in espresso blends) travel through the Suez Canal. With ships rerouting around Africa, transit times doubled and costs tripled. This isn't a temporary disruption—it's a permanent restructuring of global trade routes.</p>
        
        <h4>3. Demand-Supply Mismatch</h4>
        <p>While Western consumption grows slowly, Asia's coffee demand is exploding. China's coffee market grew 15% last year. Vietnam's domestic consumption doubled in 5 years. The same farmers exporting beans are now drinking them too.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why It Matters to You</h2>
    
    <div class="impact-section">
        <h3>💼 The Ripple Effect on Your Life</h3>
        
        <h4>For Your Wallet</h4>
        <p>Expect to pay 20-30% more for coffee this year. But it's not just your morning cup:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Restaurant prices</strong> will rise as coffee costs get baked into meal prices</li>
            <li><strong>Office perks</strong> like free coffee may disappear</li>
            <li><strong>Grocery bills</strong> will increase as instant coffee and beans get more expensive</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>For Your Community</h4>
        <p>Local coffee shops face existential threats. Many operate on 3-5% margins. A 20% cost increase could mean:
        <ul>
            <li>Small shops closing or reducing hours</li>
            <li>Fewer independent roasters</li>
            <li>Less variety and innovation in your local coffee scene</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>For Coffee Farmers</h4>
        <p>Paradoxically, most farmers aren't benefiting. Middlemen and traders capture the price increases. Many farmers are abandoning coffee for more resilient crops like avocados or cacao.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
    <p>This isn't just about coffee. It's a case study in how climate change, globalization, and shifting consumption patterns collide. What's happening to coffee today will happen to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cocoa</strong> (chocolate prices already up 60%)</li>
        <li><strong>Wheat and grains</strong> (droughts affecting bread prices)</li>
        <li><strong>Fruits and vegetables</strong> (extreme weather damaging crops)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Coffee is the canary in the coal mine for climate-impacted agriculture.</p>

    <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
    
    <div class="analysis-section">
        <h3>🔮 Predictive Analysis</h3>
        
        <h4>Short-term (Next 3 months)</h4>
        <p>Prices will continue rising as existing inventory sells out. Expect more "shrinkflation"—same price, less coffee in the bag.</p>
        
        <h4>Medium-term (6-12 months)</h4>
        <p>Major coffee companies will:
        <ul>
            <li>Increase use of cheaper robusta beans in blends</li>
            <li>Invest in synthetic coffee alternatives</li>
            <li>Acquire smaller competitors as consolidation accelerates</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Long-term (2-5 years)</h4>
        <p>Fundamental changes:
        <ul>
            <li>Coffee growing regions will shift north/south</li>
            <li>Lab-grown coffee will enter the market</li>
            <li>"Coffee tourism" to origin countries will increase</li>
            <li>New certification systems for climate-resilient farming</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Your morning coffee isn't just getting more expensive—it's becoming a luxury good. The era of cheap, abundant coffee is over. What comes next is a more expensive, more sustainable, and potentially more interesting coffee culture. The question isn't whether you'll pay more, but what you'll get for that price.</p>
